 Hello I'm Jim, WebDev learner at Becode

> I am young and motivated young man who just try to find his purpose in this wolrd.  
 I live with my girlfriend in a small village called RonquiÃ¨res in Wallonia.  
 My house is on the edge of the woods so I'm surrounded by many wild animals like hinds, birds  
 and also bad foxes trying to eat my hens every night.
