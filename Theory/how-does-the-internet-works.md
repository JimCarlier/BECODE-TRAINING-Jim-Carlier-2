#### How does the internet works?

---

## Here's a quick summary of how internet works:

Basically , the internet is a wire. Servers and computers (clients) are both connected to this wire to allow informations geeting sent to each other. Servers and computers all have an IP adress wich is a unique identifier. In order for the computer to send information to this wire, he needs an internet service provider (e.g "DSL). So when you connect to a website, wich is stored into a server, the information is sent first to the *ISP*, then travels the wire to the server. The server can either send the information back to the computer following the same path or send it trough the wire to annother computer. The information is not travelling in one block, it is dissassembled into smaller pieces called paquets and reassembled after the travel. To prevent information not getting to to good computer, those paquets are wrapped in something called router. They are placed all along the wire and they wraps and unwraps the paquets and allows them to be sent to the good IP adress.

## Maybe it can be clearer with an exemple, let's say I want to send an email to my teammate:

1. I write my email and click "send".
2. The information of the email is wrapped by the router.
2. The router send the wrapped paquets to the server called "Gmail.com"
2. The email is then sent to another server (e.g "aol.com") after being wrapped each time it goes trough a router.
2. The server finally send the email to the teammate.
