## How does the internet work ?
***

The easiest way to imagine the internet is representing it with a wire. (an actual wire, which is burried into the ground)
We can imagine that all computers that are connected on that wire, can communicate together.

Classic computers are not directly connected to the internet. These are called "Clients" because they need a ISP (Internet Service Provider, like Proximus for example)

##### What's a server ?

A Server is a special computer which is directly connected to the internet and webpages are like "files" on their HD. In order to make the information go to the right place, we us IP addresses.

> every computer or website for example on the internet, has it's own unique IP Address. (It helps computers find each other)


##### But how does my computer send files ?

When a file is sent, your computer "breaks" it into smaller peaces (called packets). When your e-mail, picture or whatever you sent reaches its destination, the computer reassembles these packets in the original order.


##### few common mistakes
- the internet is **not** a bubble cloud
- your computer at home is not a server
